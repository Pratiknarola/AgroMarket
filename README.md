<h1># Auction </h1>

<h2><b> FUNCTIONALITIES :- </b></h2> 

<b>Extended bidding :- </b>
Each auction could be configured with a scheduled finish and extension time, if a new bid was received during the closing minutes the auction finish time would be automatically extended by a pre-configured amount. This allowed users the opportunity to counter late bids and prevented auction snipers attempting to secure the item at a cheaper rate by placing a bid at the last minute or second.

<b>Incremental Bidding :- </b>
Given the pressure and time sensitive nature of placing a bid, the UI was designed to be as simple and quick as possible to use.
Users were able to set an increment value from a select box. Using this increment value combined with the current auction value, a new bid value was automatically calculated. Keeping the increment value the same, the User could then simply click Place Bid using this new value. This reduced the bidding process to a single click.

<b>Value Bidding :- </b>
Users can also bid directly by the value they want .
